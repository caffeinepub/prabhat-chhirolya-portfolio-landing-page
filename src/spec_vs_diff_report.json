  "summary": "The diff adds/adjusts CSS for the mode selector (inline-block + fit-content, absolute ::after underline spanning left/right, and a bold active class), but it does not show an active-state rule that forces the underline/border to be fully visible (scaleX(1)) when selected. There are also unrelated metadata/documentation updates not requested by the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix the PERSONAL and PROFESSIONAL mode selector text-link styling so that in the selected/active state (when the label becomes bold), the border/underline correctly spans the full rendered text width exactly as it does on hover, without changing any existing transitions/timings/animations/visual design.",
      "reason": "The CSS shows the underline expanding on hover only (.mode-selector:hover::after { transform: scaleX(1); }), but there is no shown rule that expands the underline in the active/selected state (e.g., via .mode-selector-active::after or a parent active state). Without an active-state transform override, the underline remains scaleX(0) when selected, so the acceptance criteria for active underline spanning the full bold text width is not demonstrably implemented.",
