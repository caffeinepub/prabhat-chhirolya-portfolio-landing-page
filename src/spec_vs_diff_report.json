  "summary": "REQ-2 and REQ-3 appear implemented via updates to `frontend/public/.ic-assets.json5` and confirmation of OG/Twitter meta tags in `frontend/index.html`. REQ-1 is not evidenced in the diff because no `frontend/public/ogcard.jpg` asset file was added. The diff also includes extensive unrelated frontend UI/feature changes that were not requested and may violate the constraint to avoid modifying immutable frontend paths.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure the Open Graph / Twitter card image file is present in the deployed frontend asset canister at the public root path `/ogcard.jpg` (repository contains `frontend/public/ogcard.jpg`).",
      "reason": "The diff shows no added file for `frontend/public/ogcard.jpg` (Added files: none). Without the actual JPEG in `frontend/public/`, the asset can’t be deployed/served from `/ogcard.jpg` even if metadata and asset rules exist.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: ADDED FILES: none",
        "frontend/public/.ic-assets.json5 (rule added for ogcard.jpg, but file itself not shown as added)"

      "reason": "BuildRequest is narrowly scoped to ensuring `/ogcard.jpg` is deployed/served and that existing OG/Twitter meta tags remain correct; it explicitly states to not change the portfolio UI/UX beyond what’s necessary.",
      "evidence": [

    {
      "description": "Backend/data-layer scaffolding changes (placeholder React Query hooks file).",
      "reason": "Not requested; BuildRequest focuses on static asset deployment for OG/Twitter image and maintaining meta tags.",
