  "summary": "Prabhat Chhirolya Creative OS is a dark-themed, highly animated React + Tailwind single-page portfolio. It presents an immersive landing screen with an interactive cursor/touch-responsive background and a two-mode selector (Personal Journey / Professional Work). Each mode renders a long-form, internally scrollable narrative with scroll-triggered section reveals, horizontally scrollable project carousels, and reusable ProjectCard tiles that open modal overlays with rich details (text, optional image carousel, YouTube embeds, and external links). The repo also includes Internet Computer (ICP) scaffolding: Internet Identity authentication context, React Query–based backend actor creation/caching, and a Motoko blob-storage maintenance/admin mixin. SEO/social sharing is handled via canonical + Open Graph/Twitter meta tags in server-served index.html and a deployable ogcard.jpg asset with verification documentation.",
